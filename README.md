# StudyBuddy

StudyBuddy is an iOS productivity app that runs a background timer and allows users to set the amount of time they want to study for. At the end of each study session, users are rewarded a collectable monster that can be checked on the monster shelf. Total hours and number of monsters collected can also be accessed.
